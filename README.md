### How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
Graceful degradation and service workers are related as the both contribute to improving the user experience in web applications. <br>
Graceful degradation is a design strategy that is used to ensure that a web application continues to function even when certain features fail or are not supported by the user's browser. The idea is that you provide fallback mechanisms for older browsers or in case of failures.<br>
Service workers run the background and are used to enable features such as offline function. They serve responses from a cache, which allows web applications to function even when the user is offline.
